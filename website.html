                    <p>A home, or domicile, is a living space used as a permanent or semi-permanent residence for an
                        individual, family, household or several families in a tribe. It is often a house, apartment,
                        or
                        other building, or alternatively a mobile home, houseboat, yurt or any other portable shelter.

                        shacks
                        found in slums and shanty towns. More generally, "home" may be considered to be a geographic
